#### Integration

```markdown
Blue Ocean rethinks the user experience of Jenkins. Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline, 
but still compatible with freestyle jobs, Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of the team. 
Blue Ocean’s main features include:

Sophisticated visualizations of continuous delivery (CD) Pipelines, 
allowing for fast and intuitive comprehension of your Pipeline’s status.

Pipeline editor - makes creation of Pipelines approachable by guiding 
the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a Pipeline.

Personalization to suit the role-based needs of each member of the team.

Pinpoint precision when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. 
Blue Ocean shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating 
exception handling and increasing productivity.

Native integration for branch and pull requests, enables maximum developer 
productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.
